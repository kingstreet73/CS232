1.By searching the function name “strcmp” in the assembly text, what instruction calls strcmp?
      pushl %ebx
        pushl $password
        leal -8(%ebp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        call strcmp  //<--- the call (everything else is the whole instruction of how to use strcmp)
        movl %eax,%ebx
        leal 8(%esp),%esp
        cmpl $0,%ebx
        jne .L2
        xorl %eax,%eax
        jmp .L1
.L2:
.L1:
        leal -12(%ebp),%esp
        popl %ebx

2.Where is the password “secret” stored?
Stored in the bytes in the password: section before .LC0:


3.What does leal -8(%ebp),%eax right before call strcmp do?
It finds the address of the second operand (eax) which is the input, and stores it in in the first operand.
